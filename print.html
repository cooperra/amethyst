<h1>The Amethyst Engine</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This project is a <em>work in progress</em> and is very incomplete. Pardon the
dust!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howdy! This book will teach you everything you need to know about building video
games and interactive simulations with the Amethyst game engine. This engine is
written entirely in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, a safe and fast systems programming language,
and sports a clean and modern design. More correctly, though, Amethyst is
actually a suite of separate libraries and tools that collectively make up a
game engine.</p>
<p>Amethyst is free and open source software, distributed under the
<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst/blob/master/COPYING">MIT License</a>. This means that the engine is given to you at no cost and its
source code is completely yours to tinker with. The code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst">GitHub</a>. Contributions and feature requests are welcome!</p>
<p>This book is split into seven sections. This page is the first. The others are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> – Prepare your computer for Amethyst development.</li>
<li><a href="./simple_application.html">A Simple Application</a> – Build a basic pong game in Rust.</li>
<li>Effective Amethyst – Learn how to write complex games and applications.</li>
<li>Scripting – Jump into scripted development with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.</li>
<li><a href="./glossary.html">Glossary</a> - Defines special terms used throughout the book.</li>
<li>Bibliography – Read the works that influenced the design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the crate-level <a href="http://ebkalderon.github.io/amethyst/doc/amethyst/">API documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Why are you building this?</h2>
<p>The video game industry is getting bigger every year, and it has actually been
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-makes-more-money-Hollywood-or-the-video-game-industry">outpacing Hollywood for years</a>. As game studios grow, their toolset grows
to match. Though we now have access to some great mostly free game development
tools, their workflows are <a href="http://cdn.dbolical.com/videos/engines/1/1/456/Unreal_Engine_4_Features_Trailer_--_GDC_2014.mp4.jpg">clunky</a> and unfriendly to throwaway
experimentation and iteration. Most of these tools are also pretty opaque to how
they work internally, and those that are open don't usually adhere to modern
design patterns well (think pre-C++11 idioms and convoluted class hierarchies).</p>
<p>In short, I am writing Amethyst to scratch three of my own itches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teach myself game development and computer graphics in its purest form,
rather than through the lens of a particular game engine.</li>
<li>Write a fast, modular, data-oriented, and data-driven engine suited for rapid
prototyping that demands (a little) less boilerplate from the user.</li>
<li>Build a toolset that splits up the traditional &quot;mega-editor&quot; into several
small but well-integrated tools, adhering to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>These instructions will help you set up a working Amethyst game development
environment. Then we'll test this environment by compiling a simple &quot;Hello,
World&quot; application.</p>
<p>Amethyst should compile hassle-free on any platform properly supported by the
Rust compiler. Here are the system requirements (they're pretty modest):</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum:
<ul>
<li>CPU: 1GHz, the more cores the better</li>
<li>RAM: 512 MiB</li>
<li>HDD: 17 MiB free disk space</li>
<li>OS: Windows Vista and newer, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X</li>
<li>Rust: Nightly (1.6.0 or newer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Renderer Backends:
<ul>
<li>OpenGL 4.0 or newer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This guide assumes you have nightly Rust and Cargo installed, and also
have a working Internet connection. Please take care of these prerequisites
first before proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two ways to get started working with Amethyst:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./getting_started/automatic_setup.html">Use the <code>amethyst_cli</code> tool to generate a new game project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="./getting_started/manual_cargo_setup.html">Create the Cargo crate and the &quot;resources&quot; folder structure yourself</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we're just getting started, it's fastest and highly recommended to use
<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst_cli">amethyst_cli</a>. If you're of the intrepid type, you may go the vanilla Cargo
route if you wish.</p>
<h1>Automatic Setup Using The CLI Tool</h1>
<p>An easy way to set up Amethyst and manage your project is with the
<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst_cli">amethyst_cli</a> crate. If you want to set up an Amethyst game project in Cargo by
hand, follow along with <a href="./getting_started/manual_cargo_setup.html">the next section</a> instead.</p>
<p>To install the <code>amethyst_cli</code> tool, follow along in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install amethyst_cli
$ amethyst new hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! You should now have a customized Cargo project set up in a directory
called &quot;hello_world&quot;. <code>cd</code> into it, and you should find the following file
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hello_world</strong>/
<ul>
<li><strong>resources</strong>/
<ul>
<li>Lots of junk...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>src</strong>/
<ul>
<li>main.rs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cargo.toml</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You're all set! Skip forward to <a href="./getting_started/hello_world.html">section 2.3</a> to see your setup in action.</p>
<h1>Manual Setup With Cargo</h1>
<p>For those of you who prefer working with Cargo directly, like any other Rust
project, you can. However, since this is just a &quot;Hello, World&quot; program, I would
strongly recommend using the <a href="./getting_started/automatic_setup.html"><code>amethyst_cli</code> tool</a> instead. It will save you
a whole lot of time.</p>
<h3>From Crates.io</h3>
<p>Create a new Rust executable project with <code>cargo new --bin hello_world</code> and add
the following lines to your &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
amethyst = &quot;*&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>From Git</h3>
<p>If you don't want to get Amethyst from Crates.io, you can download and compile
Amethyst from the Git repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst.git
$ cd amethyst
$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in your crate's &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;, specify the location of the <code>amethyst</code>
library yourself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies.amethyst]
path = &quot;../path/to/amethyst/folder/&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Resources Folder</h2>
<p>Every Amethyst game project must have a top-level folder called &quot;resources&quot;.
This is where your game assets are stored. In your project's root folder, create
the following folder structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>resources</strong>/
<ul>
<li><strong>entities</strong>/</li>
<li><strong>prefabs</strong>/</li>
<li>config.yml</li>
<li>input.yml</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And in the &quot;config.yml&quot; file, copy and paste this YAML configuration:</p>
<pre><code>---
logging:
    file_path: &quot;hello_world.log&quot;
    output_verbosity: medium
    logging_verbosity: debug 

display:
    brightness: 1.0
    fullscreen: false
    resolution: [1024, 768]
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;input.yml&quot; file, which normally holds key binding data, can be left blank
since this is a simple application with no user interaction.</p>
<h2>All Set!</h2>
<p>Whew, we're done! Let's move on and write our first
<a href="./getting_started/hello_world.html">&quot;Hello, World&quot; program</a>.</p>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Now, we will commence our journey in writing Amethyst applications with the
obligatory &quot;Hello, World&quot; program! In your crate's &quot;main.rs&quot; file, type out or
copy and paste the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">extern crate amethyst;

use amethyst::{Application, Duration, State, Trans};

struct HelloWorld;

impl State for HelloWorld {
    fn on_start(&amp;mut self) {
        println!(&quot;Game started!&quot;);
    }

    fn update(&amp;mut self, _delta: Duration) -&gt; Trans {
        println!(&quot;Hello from Amethyst!&quot;);
        Trans::Quit
    }

    fn on_stop(&amp;mut self) {
        println!(&quot;Game stopped!&quot;);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut game = Application::new(HelloWorld);
    game.run();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, compile and run the code with <code>cargo run</code>, or <code>amethyst run</code> if you
have the <a href="./getting_started/automatic_setup.html">CLI tool installed</a>.</p>
<p>You should see the following output print to your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>Game started!
Hello from Amethyst!
Game stopped!
</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully written your first Amethyst application.</p>
<h2>What did I just do?</h2>
<p>Whoa, that went by too fast. Let's slow down a bit and break down this example
program into bite-sized chunks. What we did is create a basic Rust crate that
hooks into the Amethyst game engine, prints some text, and then signals to the
engine to quit.</p>
<p>Amethyst operates like a state machine. Each Amethyst application has one or
more states, each of which roughly correspond to a &quot;screen&quot; seen in a game (e.g.
main menu, loading screen, in-game, inventory menu, credits). You control when
Amethyst should switch states and what happens every time you do. In our &quot;Hello,
World&quot; example, the logic flows like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize the program.</li>
<li>Create engine with <code>HelloWorld</code> as the initial state.</li>
<li>Start the engine.
<ol>
<li>Enter the <code>HelloWorld</code> state.</li>
<li>On the first frame, print &quot;Hello from Amethyst!&quot;, and signal to the engine
to quit.</li>
<li>Leave the <code>HelloWorld</code> State.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Shut the engine down.</li>
<li>Quit the program.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Can I make a game yet?</h2>
<p>This program isn't very useful on its own, but if everything compiles correctly,
then your environment is set up correctly and you can start working on the fun
stuff! Follow along in <a href="./simple_application.html">the next section</a> to see how I implement a simple
Pong clone in Amethyst.</p>
<h1>Writing a Simple Application</h1>
<p>In this section, I'll walk you through implementing a simple 3D Pong clone using
Amethyst. You will learn a bit more about game states and also basic
entity-component-system game design and we will apply those concepts and build
a little toy game. Hopefully by the end of this section, you will have gotten
the hang of working with Amethyst.</p>
<h1>Glossary</h1>
<h2>Data-driven design</h2>
<p>Describes a program that has its logic defined largely in data rather than in
compiled code. Ideally, this would permit the user to edit their code and
resources using offline tools and have the program hot-reload the changes at
run-time for instant feedback without the need for recompilation. The bare
minimum qualification for a data-driven program is the ability to read external
content (text files, scripts, byte streams) and mutate its behavior accordingly.</p>
<h2>Data-oriented programming</h2>
<p>Not to be confused with data-driven design, data-oriented programming is a
programming paradigm, like object-oriented programming (OOP) or procedural
programming. Where OOP focuses on modeling a problem in terms of interacting
objects, and procedural programming tries to model a problem in terms of
sequential or recursive steps or procedures, data-oriented programming shifts
the focus towards the data being operated on: the data type, its memory layout,
how it will be processed. Software written in a data-oriented manner tends
toward high-throughput pipelining, modularity, separation of concerns, and
massive parallelism. If architected correctly, data-oriented software can be
very cache-friendly and easy to scale on systems with multiple cores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Data-oriented programming does not necessarily imply that a program is
data-driven. Data-driven behavior can be implemented with any programming
approach you like.</p>
